Upgrading Fedora 24 Workstation to Fedora 25

Soon after release time, a notification appears to tell you an upgrade is available. You can click the notification to launch the GNOME Software app.
Or you can choose Software from GNOME Shell. Choose the Updates tab in GNOME
Software and you should see a window like this: If you don’t see anything on
this screen, try using the reload tool at the top left. It may take some time after release for all systems
to be able to see an upgrade available. Choose Download to fetch the upgrade
packages. You can continue working until you reach a stopping point, 
and the download is complete. 
Then use GNOME Software to restart your system and apply the upgrade.
Upgrading takes time, so you may want to grab a coffee and come back to 
the system later.
